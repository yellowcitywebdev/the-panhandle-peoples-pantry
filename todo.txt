Phase 1:
go over verbiage on all pages
confirm contact info(email for contact)

phase 2:
figure out contact form, membership form route and hosting

phase 3(rev.. 2):
formatting CoC
- still need from @smads
buying domain
- namecheap or porkbun
- I have an account on namecheap already
Hosting(gnat or roux)
- @Gnat has a paid Digital Ocean account I believe
    - will need to figure out form environmental variables all over again
    - testing forms one more time
- @roux has a free tier account on Netlify
    - limited traffic but should be ok starting up
    - I charge $25-30 for hosting but haven't had any takers
        - if y'all wanted to pay, I'm willing to go with the base cost($19)
    - If traffic becomes an issue, willing to pay the $19 it actually costs to upgrade to paid tier for time being
    - form environmental variable already in place so I just need Domain name and point at site
- my days available(Tues all day, Wed most of the day, Fri all day)
    - I'd like to see it live by Fri if possible
- start compiling list for next phase(shop page etc.)
