    Volunteer Code of Conduct

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary-600">Our Commitment</h2>
    <div class="text-lg text-gray-600 dark:text-white">
      <p>
        We are a volunteer-run, non-hierarchical breakfast program grounded in
        ethics, education, safety, and mutual respect. This Code of Conduct
        exists to protect the children we serve, support one another as
        volunteers, and ensure that our space is welcoming, inclusive, and
        accountable. Not only does this serve the needs of our community, it
        reflects the kind of just and liberated world we’re working toward.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary-600">Our Core Principles</h2>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6">
      <li>
        Equality & Non-Hierarchy: No volunteer holds authority over another. All
        decisions and concerns are brought to the community board, which
        operates by consensus and transparency.
      </li>
      <li>
        Safety First: Volunteers must always work in pairs when interacting with
        children. No adult should be one-on-one with a child, under any
        circumstances.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ethics & Inclusion: We are anti-racist, anti-ableist, queer-affirming,
        trauma-informed, and committed to respecting every individual’s identity
        and autonomy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Community Accountability: We believe in restorative practices, honest
        reflection, and harm reduction—not punishment. Volunteer
        Responsibilities

    </ul>

      Volunteer Responsibilities
    </h2>
    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-black">When You're On Shift:</h3>
    <ol class="list-decimal pl-6">
      <li>Always work in pairs—whether serving food or engaging with youth.</li>
      <li>
        Be respectful to everyone—kids, fellow volunteers, and families. No
        yelling, shaming, or punitive discipline. Do not talk negatively about a
        child under any circumstances, whether present or not.
      </li>
      <li>
        Keep interactions appropriate and trauma-informed. No roughhousing,
        tickling, or unwanted physical touch.
      </li>
      <li>
        Maintain confidentiality. Personal information shared by children,
        families, or volunteers should never be discussed outside the space.
      </li>
      <li>
        Respect boundaries. Always ask before physical contact (even
        high-fives), and respect “no” without question.
      </li>
      <li>
        Model inclusive language and behavior. We don’t tolerate racism, sexism,
        homophobia, transphobia, ableism, fat-phobia, or any other form of
        discrimination.
      </li>
      <li>Follow all food safety and hygiene protocols.</li>
      <li>
        Check in and check out clearly with your partner volunteers before
        leaving.
      </li>
    </ol>

      Conflict, Harm, or Concerns
    </h2>
    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-black">
      If something concerning happens:
    </h3>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6">
      <li>
        Respond and communicate to other volunteer’s as soon as possible. Never
        keep serious concerns to yourself.
      </li>
      <li>
        Harmful or unsafe behavior (especially involving children or other
        volunteers) may result in community accountability or removal from the
        program. We don’t expect perfection—but we do expect responsibility,
        self-reflection, and a willingness to grow.
